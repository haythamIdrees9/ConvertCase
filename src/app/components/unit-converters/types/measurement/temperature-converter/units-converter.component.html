    <section id="celsius-unit" aria-label="Celsius Temperature Unit Description">
        <h3>Celsius Temperature Unit</h3>
        
        <p>The Celsius temperature unit (celsius), also known as the degree Celsius (°C), is a widely used unit for measuring temperature in the metric system. It is based on the Celsius scale, where 0°C is the freezing point of water, and 100°C is the boiling point of water under standard atmospheric pressure.</p>
     
        <p>Conversion to Celsius: <strong>1 Celsius (celsius) = 1 Celsius (celsius)</strong></p>
     
        <p>The Celsius scale is commonly used in everyday life for weather forecasts, cooking, and scientific applications. In the conversion function, the value remains unchanged, as it's already in Celsius.</p>
