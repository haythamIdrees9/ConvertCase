          <h2>Angle Converter</h2>
     
          <p>The Angle Converter is a versatile tool that allows you to convert angle measurements from one unit to another. It's an invaluable resource for various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and navigation.</p>
     
          <p>Using the Angle Converter is straightforward. Follow these steps to accurately convert angles:</p>
     
          <ol>
              <li>Enter the value you want to convert in the input field. This value represents the angle you wish to convert.</li>
              <li>Select the unit you are converting from in the "From" dropdown list. This specifies the initial unit of angle measurement.</li>
              <li>Select the unit you want to convert to in the "To" dropdown list. This designates the desired angle unit for the conversion.</li>
              <li>The converted value will be displayed in the result field, providing you with an accurate angle conversion result.</li>
          </ol>
     
          <p>For example, if you need to convert degrees (Â°) to radians (rad), enter the value in degrees, select "Degree" as the "From" unit, and "Radian" as the "To" unit. Click "Convert," and you will see the equivalent angle measurement in radians.</p>
     
          <p>The Angle Converter supports a wide range of angle units, including degrees, radians, minutes of arc, and seconds of arc, making it an indispensable tool for professionals, students, and enthusiasts who require precise angle conversions for their tasks and projects.</p>
