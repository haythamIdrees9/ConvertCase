          <h2>Data Storage Converter</h2>

          <p>
               Data Storage —Converter is a multi-function converter that can convert data storage measurements between
               units. It is an invaluable reference for any data professional — IT personnel, Data Scientists, database
               administrators and anyone who has ever worked with or will ever work with digital data.</p>

          <p>

               With the Data Storage Converter you can use it very easily. Follow these steps to accurately convert data
               storage values:
          </p>

          <ol>
               <li>Type the number you want convert on input. This is how many data units you wish to convert.
               </li>
               <li>Choose the unit you’re converting from the From dropdown list. This is defined as the primary measure
                    for data storage.
               </li>
               <li>Select to which unit you want to convert from the “To” dropdown list. Specifies the target data
                    storage unit to convert from, e.g., MB to GB.
               </li>
               <li>This will result in the converted value being displayed to give you a true representation of what it
                    is stored as in the target datastore.
               </li>
          </ol>

          <p>For instance, to convert a <strong>{{linkUnitLabels[0]}} to {{linkUnitLabels[1]}}</strong>, enter the
               <strong>{{linkUnitLabels[0]}}</strong> value, choose <strong>"{{linkUnitLabels[0]}}"</strong> as the
               "From" unit, and <strong>"{{linkUnitLabels[1]}}"</strong> as the "To" unit.
               then you should see equivalent of this <strong>{{linkUnitLabels[1]}}</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>It is a Data Storage Converter that includes conversion support for almost every popular unit in the data
               storage space, from bytes and kilobytes to megabytes, gigabytes and terabytes, making it essential for
               any digital data management role or task where precise data conversions count!
