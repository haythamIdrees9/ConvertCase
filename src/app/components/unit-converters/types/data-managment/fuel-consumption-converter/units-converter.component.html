        <h2>Fuel Consumption Converter</h2>
   
        <p>The Fuel Consumption Converter is a versatile tool that allows you to convert fuel consumption measurements from one unit to another. It's an essential resource for various applications, including automotive, transportation, and energy efficiency assessments.</p>
   
        <p>Using the Fuel Consumption Converter is straightforward. Follow these steps to accurately convert fuel consumption values:</p>
   
        <ol>
            <li>Enter the value you want to convert in the input field. This value represents the fuel consumption rate you wish to convert.</li>
            <li>Select the unit you are converting from in the "From" dropdown list. This specifies the initial unit of fuel consumption measurement.</li>
            <li>Select the unit you want to convert to in the "To" dropdown list. This designates the desired unit for the conversion, such as miles per gallon (MPG) to liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km).</li>
            <li>The converted value will be displayed in the result field, providing you with an accurate fuel consumption conversion result.</li>
        </ol>
   
        <p>For example, if you need to convert <strong>{{linkUnitLabels[0]}} to {{linkUnitLabels[1]}}</strong>, enter the <strong>{{linkUnitLabels[0]}}</strong> value, select <strong>"{{linkUnitLabels[0]}}"</strong> as the "From" unit, and <strong>"{{linkUnitLabels[1]}}"</strong> as the "To" unit.  and you will see the equivalent fuel consumption rate in <strong>{{linkUnitLabels[1]}}</strong>.</p>
   
        <p>The Fuel Consumption Converter supports a wide range of units, including MPG, L/100km, kilometers per gallon (km/G), and more, making it an indispensable tool for drivers, automotive engineers, environmentalists, and anyone who needs precise fuel consumption conversions for their tasks and projects.</p>
