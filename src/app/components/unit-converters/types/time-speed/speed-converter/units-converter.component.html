        <h2>Speed Converter</h2>
   
        <p>The Speed Converter is a versatile tool that allows you to convert speed measurements from one unit to another. It's a valuable resource for a variety of applications, including transportation, sports, and scientific calculations.</p>
   
        <p>Using the Speed Converter is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to convert speed measurements accurately:</p>
   
        <ol>
            <li>Enter the value you want to convert in the input field. This value represents the speed you wish to convert.</li>
            <li>Select the unit you are converting from in the "From" dropdown list. This specifies the initial unit of speed measurement.</li>
            <li>Select the unit you want to convert to in the "To" dropdown list. This designates the desired speed unit for the conversion.</li>
            <li>The converted value will be displayed in the result field, providing you with an accurate speed conversion result.</li>
        </ol>
   
        <p>For example, if you need to convert kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s), enter the value in km/h, select "Kilometer per Hour" as the "From" unit, and "Meter per Second" as the "To" unit. Click "Convert," and you will see the equivalent speed in meters per second.</p>
   
        <p>The Speed Converter supports a wide range of speed units, including common ones like miles per hour (mph), knots (kt), and feet per second (ft/s), making it an indispensable tool for professionals, athletes, students, and anyone requiring precise speed conversions for their tasks and projects.</p>
