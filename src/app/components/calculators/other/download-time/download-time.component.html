        <h2>Understanding File Size and Data Types</h2>
        <p>
          Before we calculate download or upload times, it's essential to grasp the concept of file size and data types. File size
          determines how much data needs to be transmitted, and data types help us measure it accurately. Different units, such
          as bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes, represent varying amounts of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Byte (B):</strong> The smallest unit, typically used for small files.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Kilobyte (KB):</strong> Equivalent to 1,024 bytes, suitable for small documents and images.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Megabyte (MB):</strong> Approximately 1,024 KB or 1,048,576 bytes, common for media files.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Gigabyte (GB):</strong> Roughly 1,024 MB or 1,073,741,824 bytes, ideal for large files and videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Terabyte (TB):</strong> Around 1,024 GB or 1,099,511,627,776 bytes, used for extensive data storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section, we'll explore these data types and their significance in determining download and upload times. By
          understanding file size and data units, you'll be better equipped to estimate how long your online tasks will take.

        <h2>Exploring Bandwidth and Bandwidth Types</h2>
        <p>
          Bandwidth is a critical factor in determining how quickly you can download or upload files. It represents the capacity of
          your internet connection to transmit data. Understanding bandwidth and its various types is essential for accurate time
          calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Byte per second (Bbit/s):</strong> The smallest unit of bandwidth, often seen in basic connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Kilobyte per second (KBbit/s):</strong> Equivalent to 1,024 Bbit/s, suitable for standard internet speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Megabyte per second (MBbit/s):</strong> Approximately 1,024 KBbit/s, common for broadband connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Gigabyte per second (GBbit/s):</strong> Roughly 1,024 MBbit/s, representing high-speed internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          - <strong>Terabyte per second (TBbit/s):</strong> Around 1,024 GBbit/s, used for ultra-fast connections like fiber optics.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this section, we'll delve into the world of bandwidth and its variations. Whether you have a standard connection or
          enjoy lightning-fast speeds, understanding bandwidth types will help you accurately estimate download and upload
          times.
